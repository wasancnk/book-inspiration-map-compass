100 Mindsets and Insights for Creating Desired Future
-----------------------------------------------------
Note: These following items are curated for next 5-50 years.

1. The startup motto "Idea is cheap, execution is everything" is obsolete. 
The more fitting one in AI era is "Execution is becoming commodity, unique 
insight is priceless".

2. Though personalization is a norm, but the next form is individualization
where everyhing is built just for you, and on your device(s), locally. 

3. Once edge devices are enough powerful and can run intelligence locally,
More data will never leave the devices, causing the death of AdTech.
MarTech might shrink significantly. 

4. Moduralization will become the next wave of business transformation after
the adoption of AI to stay relevant in the era of autonomous businesses.

5. Multipolarity creates huge global gaps for inefficiency, anyone filling
this gap has a potential to create trillion dollars business.

6. All activities in this world can be encapsulated in a single word: 
"collaboration". And all activities in economy are be encapsulated in 3 words:
Consumer, supplier, and regulator. If you want to play big, you need to understand these 4 words deeply.

7. Knowledge inspires awareness. Awareness inspires desire. Desire inspires demand. 
Economic demands can be engineered through knowledge distribution.

8. All businesses are for satisfying economic demands through solving problems. 
As executions are becoming cheaper, the main factor to successfully develop 
and run business becomes how deep you can understand the chosen problem you want to solve.

9. Late launched product is not always a bad product if your product is well
product-market fit. However, the longer invested time, the risker risk of wasting time
and this can be mitigate through having the precise compass. 

10. Compass means all things you have for navigating the product and business development.
To make the accurate compass, you need to identify overlapping insights from 
many perspectives and from many sources. The more overlapping found, the more 
accurate the compass can be. 

11. There's not always the correct development strategy for your business but only
suitable to your condition. Your available capitals (financial, knowledge, talent,
connection, and time) define the options you can exercise for designing your strategy.

12. When you are ambitious, you need to accept that there will be some costs
that you have to pay. People will don't understand you. People will doubt about 
what you do. You will be lonely. And some areas of life will be imbalanced.

13. There are always few people on this world that will understand you. No matter
how ambitious or odd your ideas are. People with similar minds will naturally 
attract each other but it won't be possible if you are not discoverable first. 
Keep sharind your thoughts and ideas regularly.

14. You need to engrave "Impossibility is not in my dictionary" to your soul. 
This doesn't mean everything it is possible, but a trick to unleash your brain 
to explore all possibilities. Don't be shy about your thoughts and ideas.

15. If something is impossible, then just move yourself to a place that will 
make it possible. Though that sounds simple but the real trick of it is about 
creating inevitability through making enough conditions to make it happens.

16. When your health is in best condition, you can boost your productivity up
to 500%. And prime time often be on morning from 8AM-11AM. Afternoon is time to 
focus and is free from distraction. Move intense discussions to morning.

17. No matter how advanced the technologies will be, the nature of human 
won't be changed. The more you understand about it, the better you can leverage
using powers of communities and societies.

18. The further you can see into the future, the lesser competitions you will
be facing with. Trying to see the next 5-10 years into the future will give you
some opportunity and lesser pressure to develop something competitive and 
groundbreaking.

19. As time goes by and you get older, you may change your dream. You might be 
sad and feel the failure. It is perfectly fine, and you are not failed. In fact, 
the old dream will never be discarded. It will sit back in your heart, waiting 
the right moment to come back, eventually.

20. You can have many dreams, and it is very healthy to do so. Dreams are special
because once you set label anything as "dream" it means you are not obligated to
it and you can go far on it as much as you want. Just go all in to imagine your
dreams, never set boundaries for them.

21. The more dreams you have, the bigger detection surface for your mind to 
subconsciously scan for relevant things, allowing you to see more opportunities 
and ability to look deeper into the future. Though the future might not happen 
like what you see in the dreams but you will realize what you have to do to 
make it happens.

22. There is a theory saying that 5 people you spend most time with will shape 
your future be. However, it is not entirely true. Your future is actually get 
shaped by the most frequent themes of information you consume each day, through 
people, social media, work, hobbies, and your surround environments. Consume
information wisely if you want most accurate desired future.

23. You should spend at least 2-3 years for your first job if the culture in 
company is okay. Though salary is important but the completed domain knowledge
is even more important. Once you have at least 3-5 completed work cycle 
experiences, then you can get 2-3 times more salary in the next company.

24. Being skilled and deep at a single domain is no longer enough. To survive 
in the current era, you need to be good at 2 impactful business domains. First 
domain is digital tech, second domain is either manufacturing or servicing. 
Creativity and human skills are only good as multiplier of the base domain.
With no impactful base presents, any result of multiplication will be zero. 
It basically means that AI can replace you completely.

25. To develop the business, you have 2 ways: 1) Making it as side project and
treat it like part-time business. This is best approach to reduce risks and give
you chances to explore things with less pressure. And if you fail, you won't 
lose much. 2) Making it as full-time job and give all in. This is not recommended
because it is too risky in the current era. 

26. Best asset is not money, crypto currencies, real estate asset, but the money
generating machine, the business. Though it is most risky to create a successful 
one but it is a kind of asset that give you biggest leverage. 

27. You can start business in your mind by simulating approaches to solve valuable
problems. Try to draw your ideas on papers and break them down into parts. Then 
battle test the concepts. Get people trying to kill your concepts then continue
from the survived ones. It is better to fail your business on papers than 
wasting your money, time and other resources.

28. Business development has phases: 1) Ideate and explore, 2) Develop MVP 
(Minimum Viable Product), 3) Register and launch, 4) Build systems to sustain 
operations, 5) Build culture and scale, 6) Succession or exit.

29. There are 4 big phases of economic landscape evolution. Now we are in 
the phase of building more tools, soon the world will focus more on easing the 
collaborations between people and organization. The third phase is regeneration 
which is about fixing the world damage. The last phase is either utopia or dystopia, 
where the results of phases 2 and 3 will determine the exact last phase.

30. The root causes that shrink the number of available job positions are not 
about automation, AI, and global recession but the ineffectiveness of generating 
new solutions for problems. Though there are infinite amount of problems waiting 
to be solved, the number of people daring to think, explore, design and create 
solutions are so limited. Maybe there are just fewer than 0.1% of all populations.

31. If we can turn all the needs for repairing this world and solving inefficiency
into job positions, then we will at least have new job positions for 10 billions 
people world wide. And the number will grow even bigger if we include Mars and
other planets in the system.

32. UN and world institutions are slowly failing because they cannot align 
global incentives well. Though internet should help their goodwill reaching to 
everyone but greed driven social media platforms just drive major world 
populations away. Though people believe that social media platform era has 
ended, but the gap of unfulfilling needs has grown enough to allow the birth 
of next platform.

33. If you want to build something so ambitious and powerful, enough to be a 
new kind of world institution, then absolute transparency and neutrality are 
none negotiable qualities that you must build into the heart of that thing 
from begining.

34. New kind of currency will inevitably emerge if the current system of 
currencies fail to encourage the fair distribution of resources and influences. 
The demands may shrink but they never fade. If people run out of money to spend
for things, ancient methods of exchange might be reintroduced.

35. Don't see thing just how it is, try to figure out patterns, systems and 
machanics inside it to realize how it works and how it creates the values. 
Curiousity won't happen without proper frames to search for the understanding. 

36. Many things in this world share similar patterns. The level of similarity
among them is depended on how well you can simpify and design their abstract 
forms. The more abstract forms you can see off of them, the better you can 
leverage them into good uses.

37. Climate resilience is increasingly becoming the major security factor for 
many businesses. The businesses must be able to survive floods, fires, droughts, 
heat, disease, epandemic, power/internet outages, and more. They will be forced 
to adopt the concepts of moduralization, integration and unification in many areas.

38. Consultants as agents of business transformation performers is increasingly
in great demand due to impacts of AI, automation, supply chain relocation, 
and climate risks mitigation. While big enterprises can take care of themselves, 
400 millions SMEs (small and medium enterprises) around the world are left in
the struggles, desperately hoping for consultants to help them.
