Mindset No.1: 
----------------
The first rule if you want to design and create desired future for yourself. 
This might sound ridiculous but you need to engrave this word into your soul:
"Impossibility word is not defined in my dictionary".
Well, it doesn't mean about everything is always possible, but it is a trick to unlock your brain to be creative at the maximum.
At this stage, don't judge your ideas, just let them flow out, even some might sound weird. 


Mindset no.2:
----------------
Nothing define the failure or the impossibility of your ideas until you actually do it.
But this also not mean about mindlessly doing whatever you think.
You still need brain to calculate the risk and consequences first. 
Remember, don't just your ideas. Only result of your attempts can define them.
