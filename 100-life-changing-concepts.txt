Mindset No.1: 
-------------
The first rule if you want to design and create desired future for yourself. 
This might sound ridiculous but you need to engrave this word into your soul:
"Impossibility word is not defined in my dictionary".
Well, it doesn't mean about everything is always possible, but it is a trick to unlock your brain to be creative at the maximum.
At this stage, don't judge your ideas, just let them flow out, even some might sound weird. 


Mindset no.2:
-------------
Nothing define the failure or the impossibility of your ideas until you actually do it.
But this also not mean about mindlessly doing whatever you think.
You still need brain to calculate the risk and consequences first. 
Remember, don't just your ideas. Only result of your attempts can define them.


Mindset no.3
------------
Dealing with impossibility is not easy but not entirely impossible. 
The concept is easy, just move you into an environment to make the impossibility becomes a possibility.
This might mean moving you into a circle of people discussing about things you might need for your ambtions.
This might mean moving you into a place where that knowledge is flowing around.
This might mean moving you to a place so you can focus and randomly ask the AI from many perspectives.
Insight gathering is very first step to tackle with the impossibility. 

Mindset no.4
------------
Ideas never expire but always work as asset (money?), and they have a strong quality: compounding.
